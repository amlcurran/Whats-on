# What's on

This is an tech demo app using cross-compilation (specifically, [j2objc](http://j2objc.org/)) to write core domain logic in Java, to be reused in the iOS app. The project contains both an Android app, and an iOS app.

The premise of the app is simple - to make it as quick as possible to answer the question: "what do I have on each evening this week"?
